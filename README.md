Using www.twitchchatdownloader.com, we obtain a CSV file which we import into R using read.csv into a data frame.

If experiencing trouble with your CSV file, your CSV file may contain messages with a comma or quotation marks. 

If messages contain a comma, enclose the field with quotes.

field,2 -> "field,2" 

For quotes within a message, use double quotes "" instead of single quotes. "Hi" -> ""Hi""
